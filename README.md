# Apple-Disease-Classification

Paper Summary: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11jf7lHJU6IOVDTwE61nuoiBuO8W1_Zz3vMVJeXuR5Z4/edit?tab=t.0

This Github is split into 3 main folders. 

Code:

-DataPreprocessing: The code in this folder was the first step and was used to manipulated the data into a format that is usable for my approaches.

-Featurization: This folder consists of the initial featurization of the test dataset, then the training using shallow classifiers, and finally the testing.

-ResNet-50: This folder consists of the hyperparameter tuning and training of each version of the model, and the training+testing of the best model.


Results:

-The HPT sheet is the document I used to keep track of all the accuracies from each version of the model in all the approaches

-The pdf is the document I used to store all the results such as classification reports and confusion matrixes


User Test: All information for judge testing will be available here

-Disease Classification User Testing: This is the code for the classification function

-Images: These are some of the sample images you can run through the model for classification

-Intstructions: As the process can be quite complicated, follow these instructions to test the model on your own.
