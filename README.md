This Github is split into 2 main folders. 

Code:

-DataPreprocessing: The code in this folder was the first step and was used to manipulated the data into a format that is usable for my approaches.

-Featurization: This folder consists of the initial featurization of the test dataset, then the training using shallow classifiers, and finally the testing.

-ResNet-50: This folder consists of the hyperparameter tuning and training of each version of the model, and the training+testing of the best model.


Results:

-The HPT sheet is the document I used to keep track of all the accuracies from each version of the model in all the approaches

-The pdf is the document I used to store all the results such as classification reports and confusion matrixes
